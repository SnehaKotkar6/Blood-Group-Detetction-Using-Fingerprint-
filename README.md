# 🩸 Blood Group Detection Using Fingerprint

This project aims to **predict a person’s blood group from their fingerprint image** using Deep Learning techniques. The system uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyze fingerprint patterns and classify them into one of the blood groups: **A, B, AB, or O**.
